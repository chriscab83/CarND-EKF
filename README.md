# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

This project implements an extended kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

## Installation and Usage

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded here

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO. Please see this concept in the classroom for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./ExtendedKF

INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)

OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]
